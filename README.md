# HangmanDesktopApp

I created a desktop application with Java using a GUI. I used Swing (GUI framework for Java) to create the app. 
I created a Hangman App using an algorithm from a previous hangman program I created. In the previous hangman 
program, all input/output is done within the console. 

Gameplay
- Standard Hangman rules (5 wrong guesses and you lose)
- 1 player
- 2 Styles of play: enter a word or random word from a list (animals, verbs,or all words)


All images have been created by myself using google draw.
